                        Press release<br />
                        08 May 2023 at 10.00 a.m.<br />
                        <br />
                        Aktia was awarded the best European fixed income fund house in the series for small fund houses in the Refinitiv Lipper Fund Awards comparison. In addition, Aktia's funds once again collected first prizes in both the Nordics and Europe.<br />
                        <br />
                        In the highly competitive European market, Aktia was chosen as the best fixed income fund house.<br />
                        <br />
                        “For six consecutive years, we have been selected as the best Finnish fixed income fund house in Morningstar's comparison, and the esteemed recognition of Lipper shows that our fixed income competence is strong throughout the European reference group. This supports our offering both in Finland and in the 15 other European countries where we offer our fixed income competence,” says Uki Lammi, acting Director at Aktia Wealth Management.<br />
                        <br />
                        International first places for Aktia's funds<br />
                        <br />
                        Aktia EM Local Currency Frontier Bond, which invests in local currency bonds in emerging markets, was awarded as the best fund in the Bond Emerging Markets Global Local Currency series in Europe, Germany, Austria, and the Nordic countries during a three-year review period.<br />
                        <br />
                        Aktia Nordic Micro Cap, which invests in Nordic small companies, has been awarded the best Nordic fund in the series Equity Nordic Small and Mid-Cap during a review period of three and five years. Aktia Asset Management+ Balanced Fund has won the award for the best Nordic fund in the Mixed Asset EUR Balanced-Global series during a review period of three years.<br />
                        <br />
                        "It is great to be internationally recognised for our expertise in both fixed income and equity asset management. Thanks to our thought-out and active investment philosophy and our refined investment process, we can offer our customers first-class products", says Andreas Bergman, Director of Aktia's Portfolio Management.<br />
                        <br />

                        "We can offer a product with one of the longest return histories also in a global comparison and that represents Aktia's fixed income competence at its best. We have chosen a market and investment products, where we genuinely aim to provide the best possible solution for the investors,” says Henrik Paldynski, head of the Emerging Market team.<br />
